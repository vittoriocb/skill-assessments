## Overview

This is a simple, interactive game of TicTacToe for 2 players.

## Usage

To start make sure you are in the project directory and run `Rscript ttt.R` in the terminal or run in RStudio.

## Unit testing

I included some basic unit tests (it has much room for improvement).

To run the tests, first install testthat package by running `install.packages("testthat")`

Then make sure you are in the project directory and run `Rscript tests/testthat/test-ttt.R` in the terminal or run in RStudio.
